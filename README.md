# MonetStyleTransfer

### **Overview**
______________________________

A machine learning model that converts Monet paintings into images and images into Monet paintings. The training process calculated the discriminator loss, identity loss, and cycle loss of both generators and utilized a cache of generated images from previous iterations to improve image quality and minimize modal collapse. Implemented using PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib for visualization. 

Built using Google Colaboratory.
